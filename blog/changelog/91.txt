I'm going through a lot at the moment, but I took some time out to get this update released because I didn't want to leave it much longer for you guys :-)
I need to concentrate on college and the things going on in my life for the next couple of weeks (possibly shorter), so as the primary developer there won't be much development on the site for just a short while. I will be back developing soon, and the beta will be insane.
I am, however, always generally on CraftedIn on my phone so I'll still be active in the community despite this.

You guys are awesome, and I hope you enjoy this update.
